                <h3>Section 1: Situational Judgement &amp; Strategy Questions</h3>

                <h4>Question 1</h4>
                <p>A newly launched platform feature has gained strong engagement from early users. Scaling to the full user base may increase operational complexity and risk. You must plan a strategy that ensures adoption, manages risks, and aligns with overall business objectives.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expand the feature gradually in controlled segments to manage operational risks</li>
                    <li>Monitor user behavior carefully during scaling and make iterative improvements</li>
                    <li>Implement incremental improvements during full adoption to maintain stability</li>
                    <li>Validate the operational and technical scalability before full-scale launch</li>
                    <li>Align the scaling approach with overall business objectives and priorities</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Expand the feature gradually in controlled segments to manage operational risks</p>

                <h4>Question 2</h4>
                <p>Leadership pushes for rapid product releases to capture emerging opportunities. Your analysis indicates that rushing could negatively affect usability and customer satisfaction. You need to maintain speed while protecting the user experience.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prioritize features that provide stable value to the business in early stages</li>
                    <li>Release a core set of features and iterate quickly based on user feedback</li>
                    <li>Invest in processes and workflows that improve both speed and reliability</li>
                    <li>Define a minimum quality standard that allows timely delivery while minimizing risk</li>
                    <li>Limit feature complexity to maintain operational and customer stability</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Release a core set of features and iterate quickly based on user feedback</p>

                <h4>Question 3</h4>
                <p>Your startup launched a location-based service targeting urban professionals. After two months, early analytics show strong engagement from your small segment beta test population overall. User feedback highlights that some features are confusing or unnecessary. Leadership expects a quick decision either to pivot the product, enhance existing features, or scale as planned. You must recommend an approach that maximizes impact while managing risk.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simplify the product by removing low-value features to reduce user confusion</li>
                    <li>Pivot the product strategy to focus on the segment showing the highest engagement</li>
                    <li>Enhance the newly most-requested features to satisfy early users without changing direction</li>
                    <li>Conduct further user research before making any changes to avoid mistakes</li>
                    <li>Scale the product as planned, assuming adoption still improves over time</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Simplify the product by removing low-value features to reduce user confusion</p>

                <h4>Question 4</h4>
                <p>You are responsible for launching a platform feature that requires close collaboration across marketing, design, and business operations. Recently, you have faced delays due to misaligned goals and unclear accountability. You must drive outcomes while keeping teams aligned.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Define clear success metrics that align the goals of all cross-functional teams</li>
                    <li>Clarify responsibilities and ownership for each team and individual task</li>
                    <li>Introduce shared incentives and recognition programs to encourage collaboration</li>
                    <li>Conduct regular check-ins to monitor progress and address any misalignment</li>
                    <li>Emphasize outcome-oriented discussions rather than focusing only on outputs</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Clarify responsibilities and ownership for each team and individual task</p>

                <h4>Question 5</h4>
                <p>New privacy regulations limit access to certain user data your platform relies on for recommendations. You must find ways to maintain a personalized experience without violating regulations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lobby regulators to adjust rules before making any changes</li>
                    <li>Focus on improving user experience through generic but safe content</li>
                    <li>Reduce personalization features temporarily to comply with regulations</li>
                    <li>Redesign the recommendation engine using only compliant data sources</li>
                    <li>Continue using existing data until enforcement begins to avoid disruption</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Redesign the recommendation engine using only compliant data sources</p>

                <h4>Question 6</h4>
                <p>During the launch of a digital service, a competitor introduces a similar solution with unique features and aggressive marketing. You must decide how to respond to maintain market relevance while keeping the team motivated.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engage stakeholders to realign expectations and reallocate resources efficiently</li>
                    <li>Focus on completing current high-priority tasks before considering new actions</li>
                    <li>Break initiatives into smaller phases to adapt rapidly and respond to market changes</li>
                    <li>Continue with the original plan as is to avoid operational disruption</li>
                    <li>Reassess priorities and adjust plans without disrupting critical milestones</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Break initiatives into smaller phases to adapt rapidly and respond to market changes</p>

                <h4>Question 7</h4>
                <p>Your colleague often misses deadlines, slowing down the project. You must give feedback that holds them accountable, keeps a good relationship, and helps the project finish on time. How you handle this will also affect how the rest of the team sees leadership.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offer extra help and follow up often to guide progress</li>
                    <li>Arrange a private talk, explain the issue, and suggest ways to improve</li>
                    <li>Bring it up in a team meeting so everyone knows the expectations</li>
                    <li>Write an email listing missed deadlines and steps to fix them</li>
                    <li>Give casual, informal feedback to avoid making it seem too serious</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Arrange a private talk, explain the issue, and suggest ways to improve</p>

                <h4>Question 8</h4>
                <p>During a critical project, you notice a colleague bypassing an approval process to meet a tight deadline. Leadership expects ethical compliance but also timely delivery. You must act carefully to maintain trust and results.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow the colleague's approach to avoid delays while assuming responsibility for any issues arising later</li>
                    <li>Discuss concerns privately with the colleague, suggest compliant alternatives, and propose an approach that meets objectives without violating rules</li>
                    <li>Delay your own tasks until proper approval is enforced and avoid acting independently without leadership guidance</li>
                    <li>Ignore the behavior and proceed with your work while assuming the risk of non-compliance is minimal</li>
                    <li>Report the situation immediately to leadership without discussing with the colleague or attempting alternative solutions</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Discuss concerns privately with the colleague, suggest compliant alternatives, and propose an approach that meets objectives without violating rules</p>

                <h4>Question 9</h4>
                <p>Your team is managing two high-priority initiatives with overlapping resource needs. One team argues that their initiative will directly drive quarterly revenue, while the other emphasizes long-term operational improvements. Tensions are rising, and deadlines are approaching. Leadership expects you to resolve the conflict efficiently without escalating issues, while keeping both teams aligned and motivated.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on the initiative you manage and leave the other team to resolve their allocation</li>
                    <li>Prioritize the initiative that aligns most with leadership's immediate goals and inform the team</li>
                    <li>Review both initiatives and propose a balanced schedule, explaining your rationale to the team</li>
                    <li>Escalate the disagreement to leadership and request guidance on priorities</li>
                    <li>Let team members negotiate among themselves and intervene only if no solution emerges</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Review both initiatives and propose a balanced schedule, explaining your rationale to the team</p>

                <h4>Question 10</h4>
                <p>During a critical campaign, leadership changes the target audience and messaging due to new market insights. The team is confused and morale is fragile. You must adapt quickly while keeping focus and minimizing disruption.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make changes under your direct control while leaving other adjustments to team members handling different areas</li>
                    <li>Wait for leadership to issue a full revised plan before making any adjustments or communicating changes to the team</li>
