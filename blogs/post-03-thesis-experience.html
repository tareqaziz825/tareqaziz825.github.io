      <p>
        Nobody tells you how lonely a thesis can feel at 2 AM when your model is outputting nonsense and your deadline is three weeks away. This post is the honest account of my CSE 400 final year thesis — not the polished version in the paper, but the actual experience: the confusion, the dead ends, the moments of clarity, and what I'd do differently.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're a CS student about to start your own thesis, I hope this helps you feel less alone — and gives you a realistic map of what to expect.
      </p>

      <h2>The Starting Point: A Problem, Not a Solution</h2>

      <p>
        My thesis began not with an idea for a model, but with a problem I found genuinely interesting: <strong>how do you detect anomalous events in surveillance video when you can't collect examples of every possible anomaly?</strong> A robbery. An explosion. A sudden crowd dispersal. You can't anticipate all of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started by reading papers. A lot of papers. The first month was almost entirely literature review — which felt frustrating because I wasn't "building" anything. But this phase was crucial. I needed to understand the landscape: what had been tried, what the benchmarks were, what the open problems were.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p class="info-box-title"><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Advice for Students</p>
        <p>Don't rush to code. Spend at least 3–4 weeks reading deeply in your area before writing a single line. Understanding the existing literature will save you from reinventing the wheel — and help you identify where a genuine contribution lies.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The First Dead End: Trying to Use Supervised Methods</h2>

      <p>
        My first instinct was to fine-tune an existing anomaly detection model on the UCF-Crime dataset. I spent two weeks getting the data pipeline working, the model loading correctly, and the training loop running. The results were... okay. 76% ROC-AUC. But it wasn't novel — this had been done before, and done better.
      </p>

      <p>
        My supervisor, Prof. Dr. Md. Ashraful Alam, pushed back: <em>"What's the new contribution here? Why would someone cite this?"</em> It was the right question, and it stung. I had to go back to the drawing board.
      </p>

      <h2>The Pivot: Zero-Shot as the Core Idea</h2>

      <p>
        The pivot came from a conversation about CLIP. I had been reading about vision-language models and mentioned, almost offhandedly, that CLIP could potentially describe what's "normal" in a scene using text. My co-supervisor Md Tanzim Reza's response: <em>"What if you used that to detect what's abnormal — without ever training on abnormal examples?"</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        That was the moment the thesis crystallized. Zero-shot anomaly detection. The model would learn only from normal video, and use semantic alignment via CLIP to understand context — so that when something unusual happened, it would be flagged as a deviation from the learned normal distribution.
      </p>

      <h2>Building the Architecture: Three Components, One Goal</h2>

      <p>
        The architecture I eventually settled on had three components working together:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>TimeSformer</strong> for spatiotemporal feature extraction from video clips</li>
        <li><strong>DPC-RNN</strong> for predictive temporal modeling — learning to predict what comes next, so it can detect when something unexpected happens</li>
        <li><strong>CLIP</strong> for semantic scene context — aligning visual features with text descriptions of the scene type</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Getting these three to work together was the hardest part of the project. Each component individually worked fine. But integration introduced subtle bugs — mismatched tensor shapes, gradient flow issues, inconsistent normalization between CLIP's preprocessing and TimeSformer's.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"The most time-consuming part of ML research is rarely the model idea — it's the implementation details that textbooks don't mention."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The Training Nightmare: Google Cloud and GPU Bills</h2>

      <p>
        Training TimeSformer on the UCF-Crime dataset required a GPU with at least 24GB VRAM. My laptop didn't have that. Neither did my university's lab machines (they were always occupied). I ended up running experiments on Google Cloud Compute Engine with an A100 GPU — which was fast, but expensive.
      </p>

      <p>
        I burned through my free trial credits in the first week of serious training. After that, I was rationing GPU time, running experiments overnight to minimize cost. I learned to be extremely efficient with hyperparameter searches — no more "let's just try 50 configurations." Every run had to be justified.
      </p>

      <h2>The Breakthrough: Context-Gating</h2>

      <p>
        The model was working, but false alarm rates were high in scenes with unusual but normal activity — a crowded market, a sports event. The problem: the model had no concept of <em>scene context</em>. A crowded market should have different "normal" behavior than an empty corridor.
      </p>

      <p>
        The solution was a <strong>context-gating mechanism</strong>: CLIP classifies the scene type (outdoor, indoor, crowded, sparse) and produces a gating vector that modulates the anomaly score. The same motion that would be anomalous in an empty hallway might be completely normal in a shopping mall.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adding this single mechanism dropped false alarms by ~18% and pushed ROC-AUC from 81.2% to 84.5%. It was the kind of insight that only comes from really understanding your failure cases — not just chasing benchmark numbers.
      </p>

      <h2>What I'd Do Differently</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start the literature review earlier.</strong> I wasted time in the first month reading too broadly. Having a focused research question from the start narrows your reading list dramatically.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep a research journal.</strong> I forgot why I made certain architectural decisions midway through, which caused confusion during the write-up. Document every experiment, hypothesis, and result.</li>
        <li><strong>Fail faster.</strong> I spent too long trying to make my first approach work. Kill an idea that isn't working after two weeks of evidence — not four.</li>
        <li><strong>Write while you research.</strong> Don't leave all the writing to the end. Maintain a running document of your methodology section. It forces clarity of thinking.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        The thesis was the hardest and most rewarding thing I did at BRAC University. Seeing 84.5% ROC-AUC appear in the results table after months of work — and knowing I'd built something genuinely novel — was a feeling no course assignment had ever given me. If you're starting your own thesis, embrace the difficulty. The confusion is the process.
      </p>
