                <p>
                    If you Google "machine learning jobs in Bangladesh," the results are equal parts exciting and
                    confusing. There are posts demanding five years of experience for "junior" roles, listings that
                    conflate data entry with data science, and — occasionally — genuinely exciting opportunities at
                    local tech companies and global remote positions. As a fresh CS graduate with a deep learning thesis
                    and four ML projects, navigating this market has been a humbling education in itself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This post is for CS graduates in Bangladesh (and similar markets) who are trying to break into AI
                    and ML. I'll share what I've observed, what employers actually look for, and the practical steps I
                    took to make myself more competitive.
                </p>

                <h2>The Reality of the Local Market</h2>

                <p>
                    Let's be honest: the dedicated AI/ML job market in Bangladesh is still developing. Most local
                    companies hiring for "data science" roles actually need someone who can build dashboards, write SQL
                    queries, and produce Excel reports — valuable skills, but not what most ML graduates picture when
                    they imagine their career.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Genuinely ML-heavy roles exist at a handful of companies: some fintech firms (bKash, BRAC Bank's
                    analytics teams), telecom companies (Grameenphone, Robi), healthtech startups, and a growing number
                    of outsourcing firms that serve international clients. The number is growing, but slowly.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p class="info-box-title"><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Where to Look Locally</p>
                    <p>LinkedIn Bangladesh, bdjobs.com (filter carefully), BRAC University and other university job
                        boards, and direct outreach to companies whose tech stacks and products align with your skills.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>Remote Work: The Real Opportunity</h2>

                <p>
                    The most significant insight from my job search: <strong>the best ML opportunities for
                        Bangladesh-based freshers are remote, international roles.</strong> With a strong portfolio,
                    English proficiency, and competitive skills, a Bangladeshi ML engineer can access the same remote
                    job market as candidates in India, Eastern Europe, or Latin America.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Platforms worth exploring seriously:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Filter for "Remote" in your job search. US, UK, and EU companies
                        increasingly hire globally for ML roles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Upwork / Toptal:</strong> Freelance ML projects are abundant and well-paying. Building a
                        track record here while job hunting full-time is smart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wellfound (formerly AngelList):</strong> Excellent for startup ML roles, many of which
                        are remote-first.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kaggle:</strong> Not just competitions — the community is a powerful network for
                        visibility and job referrals.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What Employers Actually Look For</h2>

                <p>
                    After applying to dozens of roles and speaking with hiring managers, here's what actually
                    differentiates candidates:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A portfolio with real projects:</strong> Not toy tutorials — real projects with a
                        defined problem, a dataset, a methodology, and honest results. My thesis and course projects
                        gave me concrete numbers to talk about (84.5% AUC, 91.4% R²).</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub with active commits:</strong> Employers look at your GitHub profile. Clean
                        repositories with good READMEs signal professionalism and communication skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>The ability to explain your work:</strong> In interviews, I was asked to walk through my
                        thesis methodology. The ability to explain complex ML concepts simply is highly valued.</li>
                    <li><strong>PyTorch or TensorFlow proficiency:</strong> Not just "I've used it" — demonstrate you
                        understand the framework deeply enough to debug it, customize loss functions, and write
                        production-quality training loops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication and writing:</strong> This blog, my portfolio site, and a clean LinkedIn
                        profile all signal that I can communicate — which is critical for remote roles especially.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Resume That Actually Gets Responses</h2>

                <p>
                    I rewrote my resume three times before it started getting responses. The version that worked:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>One page, clean formatting, no unnecessary "objective statements"</li>
                    <li>Each project bullet led with a <em>result</em>: "Achieved 84.5% ROC-AUC, outperforming
                        state-of-the-art baseline" — not "worked on anomaly detection project"</li>
                    <li>Skills section organized by category (ML frameworks, languages, tools) rather than a flat
                        keyword dump</li>
                    <li>Links to GitHub and portfolio site prominently placed</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Building Visibility While You Search</h2>

                <p>
                    The job search doesn't have to be purely reactive. Some things that built my visibility:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Writing technical posts on LinkedIn:</strong> A post explaining a concept from my thesis
                        got significant engagement and led to direct messages from recruiters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contributing to open-source projects:</strong> Even small contributions — bug fixes,
                        documentation improvements — add credibility and show up on your GitHub profile.</li>
                    <li><strong>Participating in Kaggle competitions:</strong> A top-20% finish in a relevant
                        competition is something worth listing on a resume.</li>
                    <li><strong>This portfolio website:</strong> Having a clean, professional site that recruiters can
                        review is an instant differentiator in a market where most candidates send only a PDF resume.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Final Thoughts: Be Patient, Be Strategic</h2>

                <p>
                    The gap between what CS programs teach and what the job market demands is real — but it's
                    bridgeable. Focus on building things, writing about them clearly, and making your work visible. The
                    ML job market is competitive everywhere in the world, but freshers who combine solid fundamentals
                    with demonstrated project experience and strong communication will find their opening.
                </p>
